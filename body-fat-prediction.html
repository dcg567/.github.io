                <p class="description">
                    In this project, I utilised Python as my primary programming language along with the SciKit-learn library for implementing machine learning algorithms.<br>
                   <br> My main focus was on predicting body fat percentage using a dataset sourced from Kaggle.<br>
                   <br> I first cleaned and prepared the dataset by removing outliers and unnecessary columns, ensuring it was suitable for analysis.<br>
                   <br> Two algorithms were implemented: <b style="color: #6885de;">K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) and Decision Tree.</b><br>
                <br>I experimented with various parameters, ultimately finding that the KNN algorithm provided more accurate predictions with an average accuracy of 69.67% compared to 61.87% for the Decision Tree.<br>
                  <br>  Through this project, I gained valuable experience in data manipulation, algorithm implementation, and understanding the strengths and weaknesses of different machine learning techniques,
                    culminating in a successful prediction model.<br>
